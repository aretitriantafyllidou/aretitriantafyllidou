### [UNICEF Social Media Case Study]()

This was a two-month case study in collaboration with UNICEF, using real social media data that organization provided to our team.
We analyzed social media content and engagement to see which posts perform best and how they are perceived across different platforms. Some topics that we focused on were image color schemes, captions, messaging, and user engagement data.
Based on the analysis, we presented and proposed recommendations on how UNICEF could strengthen and optimize its social media.

### [Music Streaming Analytics Project]()

This project was part of a two-month program following coursework in Data Engineering and Business Intelligence. As a final assignment, we worked on a self-directed project in collaboration with a company in the music streaming industry, using large-scale music consumption data, using SQL for data preparation and querying and Power BI for visualization. The results were presented through interactive dashboards and data-driven insights

###  [Predicting Obesity Levels (Machine Learning Project)]()

In this project, I developed a predictive model to estimate obesity levels using health and lifestyle data from kaggle.
I cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, engineered features, and I applied supervised machine learning algorithms ( such as Random Forest, Gradiant Boosting, Logistic Regression) to predict individual obesity risk.
