##  Projects

### Thesis: ESG Adveritising Social Media and Financial Analysis

**Title:** The impact of ESG advertising on consumer perception and brand trust  

**Summary:**  For my Master’s thesis, I investigated how Environmental, Social, and Governance(ESG) related advertising affects public sentiment in social media and stock market performance. I independently collected social media and financial data using APIs and authentication keys, integrating multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis. Using sentiment analysis and event study methodology, I analyzed the relationship between ESG-related marketing campaigns and both consumer perception and financial outcomes. The research combined natural language processing of social media content with financial modeling to assess whether ESG advertising translates into measurable market value and brand trust.

**Tools & Methods:**  Python · R · API Integration · Event Study Analysis · Machine Learning · Sentiment Analysis · NLP · Financial Modelling · Time Series Analysis · Statistical Analysis

### UNICEF Social Media Case Study

### Optimizing Social Media Engagement for UNICEF Netherlands

**Title:** The impact of ESG advertising on consumer perception and brand trust  

**Summary:**  In this two month collaborative project, our team worked directly with UNICEF Netherlands analyzing 1,645 real social media posts from Facebook, Instagram and Tik Tok to capture patterns that drive the most enagement. We combined text analytics, sentiment analysis, image analysis using Google Vision API, and machine learning (Random Forest models) to determine which content characteristics maximize reactions, comments, and shares. Our findings and strategic recommendations were presented directly to UNICEF NL's marketing team to optimize their social media strategy.

**Tools & Methods:** Python · R · Random Forest · Linear Regression · NLP · Sentiment Analysis · Google Vision API · Web Scraping · Image Analytics · Statistical Analysis · Stakeholder Presentation

### Chinook Music Store Data Warehouse

### Building an ETL Pipeline for Music Retail Analytics

**Title:** End-to-End Data Warehouse Implementation with Dimensional Modeling and Business Intelligence Integration

**Summary:** In this data engineering project, our team designed and built a data warehouse for a digital music store, transforming operational data into an analytical platform. Working with the Chinook database we implemented a complete ETL pipeline following Kimball dimensional modeling methodology. The project features a star schema with 7 dimension tables and 1 fact table, including advanced techniques like Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2) for historical customer tracking and a date dimension spanning 990+ years. Thge final step of the project was to create interactive Power BI dashboards to enable sales performance analysis, customer behavior insights. 

**Tools & Methods:** SQL Server · Power BI · ETL Development · Star Schema Design · Dimensional Modeling · SCD Type 2 · Foreign Key Constraints · Business Intelligence · Dashboard Development

**Certification:** ReGeneration Academy - Business Intelligence & Data Engineering (100-hour program, Nov 2023 - Jan 2024)

###  Predicting Obesity Levels (Machine Learning Project)

**Title**: Predicting Obesity Levels Using Machine Learning Methods

**Summary**: In this  project, I analyzed health and lifestyle data to predict obesity levels using supervised learning algorithms. I preprocessed and engineered features, applied three different machine learning models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Conditional Inference Trees), and achieve 89.83% accuracy. 

**Tools & Methods**: R · Machine Learning · Random Forest · Support Vector Machines · Conditional Inference Trees · Feature Engineering · Cross-Validation · Model Interpretability · Data Visualization · Statistical Analysis
