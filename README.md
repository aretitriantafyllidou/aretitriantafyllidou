#  Hi, I'm Areti 👋 

Welcome to my portfolio!
I’m a recent graduate in Data Science and Marketing Analytics, based in the Netherlands. I am passionate about working with data and how infrortmation can provide interesting discoveries to help us improve and grow. Here you’ll find a selection of data science projects I have worked on.

##  Projects

### Thesis: ESG Adveritising Social Media and Financial Analysis

**Title:** The impact of ESG advertising on consumer perception and brand trust  

**Summary:**  For my Master’s thesis, I investigated how Environmental, Social, and Governance(ESG) related advertising affects public sentiment in social media and stock market performance. I independently collected social media and financial data using APIs and authentication keys, integrating multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis. Using sentiment analysis and event study methodology, I analyzed the relationship between ESG-related marketing campaigns and both consumer perception and financial outcomes. The research combined natural language processing of social media content with financial modeling to assess whether ESG advertising translates into measurable market value and brand trust.

**Tools & Methods:**  Python · R · API Integration · Event Study Analysis · Machine Learning · Sentiment Analysis · NLP · Financial Modelling · Time Series Analysis · Statistical Analysis

### UNICEF Social Media Case Study

### Optimizing Social Media Engagement for UNICEF Netherlands

**Title:** The impact of ESG advertising on consumer perception and brand trust  

**Summary:**  In this two month collaborative project, our team worked directly with UNICEF Netherlands analyzing 1,645 real social media posts from Facebook, Instagram and Tik Tok to capture patterns that drive the most enagement. We combined text analytics, sentiment analysis, image analysis using Google Vision API, and machine learning (Random Forest models) to determine which content characteristics maximize reactions, comments, and shares. Our findings and strategic recommendations were presented directly to UNICEF NL's marketing team to optimize their social media strategy.

**Tools & Methods:** Python · R · Random Forest · Linear Regression · NLP · Sentiment Analysis · Google Vision API · Web Scraping · Image Analytics · Statistical Analysis · Stakeholder Presentation

### Music Streaming Analytics Project

This project was part of a two-month program following coursework in Data Engineering and Business Intelligence. As a final assignment, we worked on a self-directed project in collaboration with a company in the music streaming industry, using large-scale music consumption data, using SQL for data preparation and querying and Power BI for visualization. The results were presented through interactive dashboards and data-driven insights

###  Predicting Obesity Levels (Machine Learning Project)

**Title**: Predicting Obesity Levels Using Machine Learning Methods

**Summary**: In this  project, I analyzed health and lifestyle data to predict obesity levels using supervised learning algorithms. I preprocessed and engineered features, applied three different machine learning models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Conditional Inference Trees), and achieve 89.83% accuracy. 

**Tools & Methods**: R · Machine Learning · Random Forest · Support Vector Machines · Conditional Inference Trees · Feature Engineering · Cross-Validation · Model Interpretability · Data Visualization · Statistical Analysis
