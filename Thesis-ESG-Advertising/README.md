#  ESG Advertising & Market Reactions

**Master’s Thesis – Erasmus University Rotterdam (2025)**  
**Author:** Areti Triantafyllidou  

This project explores how **ESG-focused advertising campaigns** influence both **consumer sentiment** and **financial market reactions**.  
Using multilingual NLP and event-study econometrics, it quantifies how authentic, socially responsible communication impacts trust and market performance.

### � Tech Stack & Rationale
- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, transformers) — preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models.  
- **R** (tidyverse, sandwich, eventstudies) — econometric modeling, robust regression, and event-study analysis.  
- **RoBERTa (Hugging Face)** — transformer-based sentiment model for multilingual and complex text.  
- **Zero-shot classification (Hugging Face)** — label detection for purchase intent and ESG theme without manual annotation.  
- **yfinance / quantmod** — financial data extraction and CAR/BHAR computation.  
- **Power BI / Looker Studio** — interactive visualization and dashboarding.

###  Data Collection
Public engagement data were scraped from **YouTube** and **Twitter** campaigns through a combination of official APIs and automated collection tools.  
All comments were **anonymized** and **aggregated** to ensure privacy.  
Synthetic samples are included for reproducibility.

### 🔍 Highlights
- **Authentic ESG ads → higher consumer trust**  
- **Positive sentiment** around campaigns predicts **short-term abnormal returns**  
- **Platform effect:** Twitter shows stronger sentiment volatility than YouTube  
- **Greenwashing risk** weakens market reactions  
- **Stakeholder alignment** amplifies the ESG–performance link
