This project investigates how ESG-focused advertising campaigns influence both consumer sentiment and financial market reactions by combining multilingual NLP, sentiment analysis, and event-study econometrics.
The dataset includes 90+ ESG and non-ESG campaigns from 30+ global brands (Nike, Adidas, Apple, Coca-Cola, etc.), analyzed across YouTube and Twitter.
